# setup

## Description

Setup after the archlinux install
Uses a bash script to install ansible and other packages 
that are needed to do a snapshot before and after the install
and setup grub to be able to access. 
And obviously runs ansible playbooks.
The ansible does the rest.


## Installation

1. Get the install bash script
2. Execute

Is that fucking easy
